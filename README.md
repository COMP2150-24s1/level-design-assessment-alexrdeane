# COMP2150  - Level Design Document
### Name: Alexander Deane
### Student number: 47517514

In my level design document I will discuss and explain how my project achieves the requirements of the assignment specifications with examples found in the level and how I iterated through the design to the final version I have submitted.

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

In the below section, I will go into detail explaining my reasoning for using specific design approaches that demonstrate how I have planned my level around core player interactions that give the player target experiences that I wanted to acheive.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

Throughout my level I have created puzzles and obstacles for the player to overcome and solve, these puzzles act as simple barriers that the player must navigate around with a specific or multiple mechanics, or the puzzle will allow the player to get a reward through the keys and health pickups. I have recreated and modified similar puzzles in each section by adding additional stressors such as enemies and spikes which will increase the challenge but also allow the player to discover what mechanics are consistently able to solve puzzles and learn what new mechanics I have intended for them to use in later iterations of the same obstacle.

Below is a puzzle from the first section of my level which requires the player to push a moveable box against a high wall which will create stairs for the player to climb over the tall wall (this is not an up to date image of the level as I changed the design later on).

**(updated moveable box puzzle to create stairs over wall).**

There are no stressors added to this puzzle and I have designed the platforms around the puzzle to prevent the player from soft-locking the level or preventing a sollution from being achievable.

**(same moveable box puzzle to create stairs over wall but with added pressure pad and walls)**

By adding walls and a pressure pad the player discovers that debris slows down movement when pushing the box and that the box will activate pressure pads that it slides onto. This is one example of how my level teaches players how each mechanic and object works within the level and facilitates and encourages learning.





that are given in each section with various iterations, by repeating similar challenges with new or unique stressors included give the player additional discovery milestones that I aimed to give players of my level. I do this so that the player can learn how the level expects the player to react to an obstacle and solve the puzzle in an expected way that is also rewarding. The puzzles aren't necessarily challenging in complexity but I gradually increase the pressure that the player feels when completing the same or similar puzzles later on. 

For example below is an image from section 1 of my design that contains a simple puzzle:

![This is an image from section 1 that depicts a corridor with a box on the left and a large pillar on the right](DocImages/screen2.PNG)

The solution to this puzzle is to move the box towards the wall on the right which will allow the player to jump onto the box and over the pillar.
The same puzzle is shown in the image example below however with added stressors of walls and a chomper to occupy the player (I have also added a slow moving spike wall that follows the player but that has not been displayed in the image).

![This is a later version of the same puzzle but with added stressors to the challenge](DocImages/screenSect3box.PNG)

Throughout each section new and continued puzzles are available for the player to discover what I have planned in each section and with each obstacle the player will learn more uses and mechanics that are available that can help to solve these challenges.




### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.
